We wish to crowdsource the capturing of the layout of 8-bit chips from
the 70s and 80s, in a general way (so, 16 and 32 bit chips too.)

The visualchips project at visual6502.org has a collection of old
chips which are being depackaged, deprocessed and photographed. 

To fully understand those chips we need to capture polygon data
corresponding to the photographs.  The photographs are huge, and it
takes a few months of hobbyist time to go over every square micron and
trace the outlines of each shape on each layer. 

This, the crowdsource-server project mastered at
  https://github.com/adc/crowdsource-server
together with the crowdsource-polygons (client) project mastered at
  https://github.com/trebonian/crowdsource-polygons
aims to accelerate the capturing of polygons, by casting it as a
simple online game and making it fun. 

The aim is to have a single page somewhere like
http://visual6502.org/crowdsource.html which presents a photo of a
small patch of a chip. The player gets points and promotions according
to progress and the accuracy of their work.  Each tile should take
something like 5 to 15 minutes to capture. 

The player will need a login so we can accumulate their scores, and
we'll present motivating feedback including a leader board and an
impression of overall progress on the chip.  Somehow we'll give an
immediate score for each submission, and possibly we'll later issue a
quality bonus when the tile is re-scored.

We hope to see several tiles submitted during a single session, but
each tile is small and self contained so there will be no way to save
progress locally. 

As a secondary goal, we might try to make this single-page polygon
capture tool work on touchpad or handheld devices. Desktop is the
primary platform (unless the other is really easy)

Most of the complexity will be on the server side. A suitable server
setup will allow local testing - github's gh-pages won't host complex
servers. 
  ruby -rubygems go.rb
will listen on port 4567 and will require these packages
  apt-get install libsqlite3-dev libsinatra-ruby ruby rubygems
  gem install sinatra
  gem install dm-core dm-validations dm-timestamps dm-sqlite-adapter
  gem install haml fast-aes
  gem install clipper
There's a command line tool for user management
  ruby ./userman.rb
which requires
  gem install termios pony
(At least one admin and one ordinary user will be needed)

We'll have a more detailed design document elsewhere.
